  ## Project Overview
  Bharat Herald, a 70-year-old legacy newspaper, is facing an existential crisis in the post-COVID digital era.  
  Once printing over **1.2 million copies daily**, circulation dropped drastically between 2019–2024.  

  The company’s 2021 digital pilot failed due to poor mobile usability, advertiser confidence declined, bureaus shut down, and employees were laid off.

  This project analyzes Bharat Herald’s **2019–2024 operational and financial data** to uncover what went wrong and recommend a **phased digital transformation strategy**.  

  ---

  ## Problem Statement
  - **Goal:** Provide insights to guide a legacy newspaper’s survival in a digital-first world.  
  - **Mandate:** Quantify the decline, assess city readiness, and recommend recovery strategies.

  ## Data Sources
  All datasets are cleaned and stored in `/Datasets/`:

  1. **fact_print_sales_cleaned** – edition, city, copies sold, returned, net circulation  
  2. **fact_digital_pilot_cleaned** – platform, costs, reach, downloads, engagement, city_id  
  3. **fact_city_readiness_cleaned** – literacy, smartphone, internet penetration, year, quarter  
  4. **fact_ad_revenue_cleaned** – edition, ad category, revenue by quarter  
  5. **dim_city_cleaned** – city, state, tier  
  6. **dim_ad_category_cleaned** – ad category details  

  Each file is documented in `metadata.txt`.

  ## Analysis Approach
  - **MySQL** → Answered structured ad-hoc business requests  
  - **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** → Cleaned and explored datasets, exported all to Excel  
  - **Power BI** → Built an interactive dashboard for insights
